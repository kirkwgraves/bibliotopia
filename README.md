# Bibliotopia

Bibliotopia is a web app for bibliophiles and literary types looking for a little more sophistication in thier digital reading lives. With the app, users can search for books using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) and read published **New York Times** reviews of bestsellers, classics, and many more. Users can create accounts and design their own 'bibliotopias' by adding books to their Reading Nook, rating them, and even reading those books in-app by making use of the [Google Books Embedded Viewer API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/viewer/developers_guide).
